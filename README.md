## Description

This project is a simple equation solver. 
It takes a polynomial equation as input and returns the solution(s) of the equation. 
The equation can be of any degree, but the program is limited to solving equations of degree 2 or less.

## Mandatory part

- The program must takes a polynomial equation as input.
- The program must show the reduced form of the equation.
- The program must show the degree of the equation.
- The program can solve any equation of degree 2 or less.
- The program must show the solution(s) of the equation.

## Bonus part

- The user can enter a polynomial equation with any degree if none is supplied as an argument.
- The program plot the equation if it's degree is 2 or less.
- The program show the discriminant of the equation if it's degree is 2.
- The program verify the solution(s) of the equation.
